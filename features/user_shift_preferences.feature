Feature: Set User Preferences for Workshifts
  As a co-op member
  In order to be assigned shifts that I like
  I would like to be able to set my shift preferences for the semester.
  
  Background:
    Given I am logged in
    And the following metashifts exist:
    | category      | name                             | id | description                                   |
    | Kitchen       | Kitchen Manager                  | 1  | Refer to bylaws for manager description.      |
    | Kitchen       | Dishes                           | 2  | Use a sponge and soap to scrub off each dish. |
    | Kitchen       | Head Cook                        | 3  | Lead a team in cooking meals.                 |
    | Garbage       | Waste Reduction Coordinator      | 4  | Coordinate waste reduction. Go to CO.         |
    | Garbage       | TRC (Trash, Recycling, Compost)  | 5  | Take out trash, recycling and compost bins.   |
    
    And I am on the set preferences page
