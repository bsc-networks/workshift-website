    %h1 Workshift Marketplace
    :markdown
      Residents can buy and sell shifts here. Sell shifts that you are unable to
      complete and you will only lose 1x the amount of hours the shift is worth,
      versus losing 2x the amount of hours if you blow the shift. You will not be
      penalized if no one buys the shift **as long as** you sell the shift **at least
      24 hours before** it is begins. Buying shifts and completing them will increase your
      hours balance by 1x the amount of hours the shift is worth. **IMPORTANT:** Once
      you buy a shift it becomes **YOUR** responsibility.
