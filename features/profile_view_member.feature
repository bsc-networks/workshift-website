Feature: Viewing User Profile as a Member
  As a member of a coop,
  In order to stay on track with my workshift hours,
  I would like to view my edit balance, fine balance, shift assignment, and signoff history on one page.
  
  Background:
    Given I am the following user:
    | first_name | last_name | email           | password | permissions | hour_balance | fine_balance |
    | Giorgia    | Willits   | gw@berkeley.edu | tortoise | 0           | 18           | 100          |

  Scenario: A member views their profile while logged in
    Given I am logged in
    And I am on the home page
    When I follow "Profile"
    Then I should be on my profile page
    Then I should see the following: "Hour Balance", "Fine Balance", "Permanent Shift Assignment", "Signoff History", "18", "100"
    And I should see "Edit Profile"
    And I should not see the following: "Create Users", "Create Workshifts", "Assign Workshifts", "View Weekly History"
    
  Scenario: A member tries to edit their profile
    Given I am logged in
    Given I am on my profile page
    When I follow "Edit Profile"
    Then I should be on my edit profile page
    
  Scenario: A member tries to view their profile while not logged in
    Given I am not logged in
    And I am on the home page
    Then I should not see "Profile"
