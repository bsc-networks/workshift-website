Feature: Viewing User Profile as an Admin
  As a workshift manager,
  In order to manage coop workshifts and stay on track of my own hours,
  I would like to view my information and be able to edit users and workshifts on one page.
  
  Background:
    Given I am the following user:
    | first_name | last_name | email           | password | permissions | hour_balance | fine_balance |

    And I am logged in
