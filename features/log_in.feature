Feature: Log in to the Application
  As any user, with any set of permissions
  In order to view pages on the site that I have permissions for
  I want to be able to log in to the app.

Background: users in database

  Given the following users exist:
  | first_name      | last_name     | email                     |   password     |    permissions   |
  | Eric            | Nelson        | ericn@berkeley.edu        |   bunnny       |      0           |
  | Alex            | Danilychev    | danilychev@berkeley.edu   |   rabbit       |      0           |
  | Yannie          | Yip           | yannie.yip@berkeley.edu   |   doggy        |      1           |
  | Giorgia         | Willits       | gwillits@berkeley.edu     |   tortoise     |      2           |
